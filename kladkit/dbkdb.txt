1.0	ABSTRACT

	THE RANDOM NUMBER INSTRUCTION TEST IS DESIGNED TO EXPOSE PRO-
	CESSOR MALFUNCTIONS BY GENERATING AND EXECUTING RANDOM (NON
	PC-CHANGE) INSTRUCTIONS IN THE FAST ACCUMULATORS 11-16.  THE
	OPERANDS OF THESE INSTRUCTIONS REFERENCE ACCUMULATORS 0-7.  THE
	AC INSTRUCTION LOOP IS DUPLICATED IN NORMAL CORE MEMORY AND THE
	RESULTS COMPARED WITH THE FAST AC RESULTS IN AC 0-7.
	THE FAST AC LOOP IS ALSO SIMULATED AND THE SIMULATED RESULTS
	COMPARED WITH THE FAST AC RESULTS AND THE CORE MEMORY RESULTS.

	THE PROGRAM INCORPORATES DDT TO FACILITATE ERROR ISOLATION AND
	REPAIR.  CONTROL MAY BE TRANSFERED TO DDT AT ANY TIME BY TYPING
	AN ALT-MODE ($) ON THE TTY.

2.0	REQUIREMENTS

2.1	EQUIPMENT

	A PDP-10 KI10 EQUIPPED WITH A MINIMUM OF 32K OF MEMORY.
	CONSOLE TELETYPE
	LINE PRINTER (OPTIONAL)

3.0	PROGRAM PROCEDURES

3.1	LOADING PROCEDURE

	RUN WITH "DIAMON".

3.2	STARTING PROCEDURE

	A.  SELECT OPERATIONAL CONSOLE DATA SWITCH SETTINGS (REFER TO
	    4.0 DATA SWITCH FUNCTIONS).

	B.  EXEC MODE
	    STAND ALONE STARTING ADDRESS IS 30000.
	    SPECIAL FEATURE START (CLEAR OPERATING TOTALS) IS 30004.

	C.  USER MODE

	    WHEN LOADED AND RUN WITH "DIAMON" WILL RUN 2 PASSES.
	    TO THEN RUN FOREVER, TYPE "STD" TO "DIAMON".

	    IN USER MODE THE FOLLOWING QUESTIONS WILL BE ASKED TO
	    SELECT THE OPERATIONAL SWITCHES:

		TELETYPE SWITCH CONTROL ? 0,S,Y OR N (CR) -

		IF THE OPERATOR TYPES "N", THE ACTUAL CONSOLE SWITCHES
		ARE USED.

		IF THE OPERATOR TYPES "Y", THE FOLLOWING:

		SPECIFY LH SWITCHES IN OCTAL -

		SPECIFY RH SWITCHES IN OCTAL -

		IF THE OPERATOR TYPES "0", ZERO'S ARE USED FOR THE 
		SWITCH SETTINGS.

		IF THE OPERATOR TYPES "S", PREVIOUSLY SET SWITCHES
		ARE USED.  THIS IS ONLY VALID UPON RESTARTING OF AN
		INTERRUPTED PROGRAM.

	D.  IF IT IS DESIRED TO SPECIFY THE INITIAL BASE RANDOM NUMBER
	    SET SWITCH 'RANBAS' (BEFORE STARTING) AND RESPOND TO THE
	    FOLLOWING TYPE-OUT ACCORDINGLY.

			SPECIFY RANDOM NUMBER BASE -

3.3	OPERATING PROCEDURE

	A.  TO THROUGHLY TEST ALL HARDWARE, ALL TEST CONTROL DATA SWITCHES
	    SHOULD BE SET TO 0.

	B.  WHEN DEBUGGING HARDWARE, SET SWITCHES TO 0.  ALLOW THE
	    TELETYPE TO PRINT THE ERROR MESSAGES.  THIS ALLOWS THE PRO-
	    GRAM TO RUN A COMPLETE PASS AND THEN THE ERROR MESSAGES
	    MAY BE CORRELATED TO QUICKLY DIAGNOSE THE FAILURE.  IF IT
	    IS DESIRED TO LOOP ON A FAILURE SET THE LOOP ON ERROR SWITCH.
	    THE FIRST FAILURE WILL THEN CAUSE THE PROGRAM TO ENTER A
	    LOOP SUITABLE FOR DEBUGGING.  TO PRINT ALL ERRORS, EVEN IN
	    A DEBUGGING LOOP, SET THE PRINT ALL ERRORS SWITCH.

	    THE ERROR MESSAGES USED IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE LISTING, DDT,
	    AND SCOPING IF NECESSARY SHOULD ALLOW THE FAILING COMPONENT
	    TO BE ISOLATED AND REPLACED AND/OR REPAIRED.

	C.  ERROR INFORMATION MAY BE OBTAINED QUICKLY BY PRINTING ERRORS
	    ON THE LINE PRINTER.

	D.  PFSTRT - 30005  ; TO RESTART PROGRAM AFTER POWER FAILURE.

	E.  START1 - 30013  ; TO CONTINUE PROGRAM WITHOUT INITIALIZING
	    RANDOM NUMBER GENERATOR.

	F.  START2 - 30014  ; TO CONTINUE EXECUTION OF A FAILING INSTRUCTION
	    LOOP.

	G.  DDT - DDT MAY BE ENTERED DIRECTLY UPON STARTING THE PROGRAM
	    BY SETTING SWITCH 18.  DDT MAY ALSO BE ENTERED DURING RUNNING
	    OF THE PROGRAM BY TYPING AN ALT-MODE ($) ON THE TTY.

	    STARTING ADDRESS OF DDT IS 30007(8).

5.0	ERRORS

	ERROR MESSAGES ARE PRINTED ON THE TTY OR LINE PRINTER.  THE
	ERROR MESSAGE CONTAINS THE FAILING INSTRUCTION GROUP, THE 
	ORIGINAL OPERANDS, THE FAST AC RESULT, THE CORE MEMORY
	RESULTS, THE INSTRUCTION SIMULATION, AND THE SIMULATED ANSWERS.

	IF THE LOOP ON ERROR SWITCH IS SET THE PROGRAM WILL CYCLE ON THE
	FAILING INSTRUCTION SEQUENCE IN AC'S 11 THRU 17.  FAILURE ANALYSIS
	MAY BE PERFORMED BY EXAMINING THE INSTRUCTIONS WITH DDT (ENTERED
	BY TYPING AN ALT-MODE ($) ON THE TTY) AND BY RESTARTING THE
	LOOP AT AN APPROPRIATE RESTART ADDRESS.

	NOTE:  IT IS POSSIBLE THAT ANY ONE OF THE INSTRUCTION SEQUENCES
	       MAY HAVE FAILED.  ANALYSIS OF THE ERROR MESSAGE
	       PRINTOUT IS REQUIRED TO DETERMINE THE ACTUAL CAUSE OF 
	       THE FAILURE.

	THE FOLLOWING EXAMPLE ERROR MESSAGE INDICATES AN INCORRECT
	RESULT IN FAST AC 2.

6.0	ITERATION COUNT

	THE ITERATION COUNT OF THE PROGRAM IS DISPLAYED IN THE MEMORY
	INDICATORS (MI).  THIS COUNT IS A DECREMENTING COUNT AND INITIALLY
	STARTS AT -1 IN STAND-ALONE OPERATION.

7.0	CYCLE TIME

	THIS PROGRAM IS A RELIABILITY TEST USING RANDOM NUMBERS AND 
	AS SUCH SHOULD BE RUN LONG ENOUGH TO INSURE THAT ENOUGH
	NUMBERS ARE PROCESSED TO VERIFY SYSTEM RELIABILITY.

8.0	OPERATIONAL VARIATIONS

	A.  DIAGNOSTIC MONITOR

	    THIS PROGRAM IS USABLE WITH THE DIAGNOTIC MONITOR TO
	    PROVIDE RELIABILITY TESTS, ACCEPTANCE TESTS, AND/OR TO
	    PROVIDE A QUICK METHOD OF ISOLATION OF A FAULT TO A
	    PARTICULAR AREA OF THE PROCESSOR.  CERTAIN PROCEDURES
	    ARE USED WHEN THE PROGRAM IS USED IN THIS MANNER.
	    THEY ARE:

	    1.  THE DIAGNOSTIC MONITOR TRANSFERS CONTROL TO THE 
		PROGRAM AND STARTS IT AT LOCATION 30002.

	    2.  MONFLG - LOCATION 30042 IS USED AS THE DIAGNOSTIC
		MONITOR SPECIAL USER MODE FLAG.

		-1  ,	NORMAL USER MODE OPERATION
		 0  ,	SPECIAL USER MODE OPERATION, I/O TREATED AS 
			EXEC AND PROCESSED BY THE DIAGNOSTIC MONITOR.

	    3.  MONCTL - LOCATION 30043 IS USED AS THE DIAGNOSTIC
	    	MONITOR CONTROL WORD.

			LH = 0, STAND ALONE OPERATION

8.0	OPERATIONAL VARIATIONS (CON'T)

	B.  USER MODE

	    TO OUTPUT THE PRINTED ERROR MESSAGES TO A USER SPECIFIED
	    DEVICE IN USER MODE, ASSIGN THE DESIRED OUTPUT DEVICE
	    TO DEVICE NAME 'DEV' AND SET SWITCH 'PNTLPT'.  THE
	    PHYSICAL DEVICE USED CAN BE ANY DEVICE THAT CAN ACCEPT
	    ASCII OUTPUT FORMAT SUCH AS LPT, DSK, DTA, ETC.  THE
	    CORRESPONDING OUTPUT FILE IS 'DBKDB.TMP'.

	    EXAMPLE DEVICE ASSIGNMENT:

	    .ASSIGN DSK DEV

	    IN USER MODE THE PROGRAM WILL MAKE TWO PASSES AND THEN 
	    RETURN TO MONITOR MODE.

	    THE OUTPUT FILE (IF USED) MAY THEN BE LISTED BY USING THE
	    NORMAL MONITOR COMMANDS (R PRINT, LIST, TYPE, PIP, ETC.).

	    IF THE PROGRAM IS ABORTED BEFORE COMPLETION (BY ^C, ETC.)
	    THE OUTPUT FILE MAY BE CLOSED BY USING THE MONITOR 'REENTER'
	    COMMAND.

12.0	SIMULATOR
	---------

	THE PDP-10 KI10 SIMULATOR IS USED TO SIMULATE THE ACTUAL 
	HARDWARE OPERATION OF THE PDP-10 KI10 CENTRAL PROCESSOR. THE
	PURPOSE OF THIS SIMULATION PROGRAM IS TO PROVIDE A
	MEANS OF HARDWARE DEVELOPMENT AND MACHINE CHECKOUT. THE
	SIMULATION PROGRAM MAY ALSO BE USED FOR DIAGNOSTIC PROGRAM
	DEVELOPMENT AND AS A PROGRAM OPERATION TRACE DEBUG SYSTEM. 
	THE SIMULATION IS ACCOMPLISHED THROUGH SOFTWARE BY USING PROGRAM
	ROUTINES TO FOLLOW THE HARDWARE OPERATION FLOW AND CORE MEMORY
	LOCATIONS AS PSEUDO HARDWARE REGISTERS.

	A. DDT PROGRAM TYPE-IN SIMULATION
	   ------------------------------

	TO USE THE SIMULATOR TO SIMULATE A SMALL PROGRAM TYPED-IN
	WITH DDT THE FOLLOWING PROCEDURE (EXAMPLE) IS USED.

	START PROGRAM WITH SWITCH 'ENTDDT' SET SO THAT CONTROL TRANSFERS
	TO DDT.

	*DDT*

	PATCH!		DMOVE 0,PATCH+10 ;SAMPLE PROGRAM (DDT TYPIN)

	SIMDDT$G		;TRANSFER TO SIMULATOR

	INPC =   RIGHT HALF IS OBJECT PROGRAM STARTING ADDRESS
		 LEFT HALF = 0 = EXEC MODE OBJECT PROGRAM
			   =10000 = USER MODE OBJECT PROGRAM

	MASK =   WORD TO ALLOW CHECKING OF ONLY DESIRED INSTRUCTION CODE
		 BITS TO DETERMINE INSTRUCTION SIMULATION PRINTOUT.

	INSTR = WORD TO FURTHER SELECT INSTRUCTIONS TO BE PRINTED.
	CNTLPC = WORD USED TO PREVENT SIMULATION PRINTOUT UNTIL THE
		 OBJECT PROGRAM PC IS EQUAL OR GREATER.

	UPRPC = WORD USED TO PREVENT SIMULATION PRINTOUT WHEN THE
		OBJECT PROGRAM PC IS GREATER THAN.
						MAINDEC-10-DBKDB.TXT
						PAGE 13

	B.  SIMULATOR PRINT PROGRAM
	    -----------------------

	THE SIMULATOR PRINT PROGRAM PROVIDES A BREAK POINT IN THE 
	MAIN SIMULATOR MASTER CLOCK CYCLE AT WHICH TIME TRANSFER IS MADE 
	TO  THE SIMULATOR PRINT PROGRAM.  THE PRINT PROGRAM THEN DETER-
	MINES IF THE MASTER CLOCK IS AT THE FIRST INSTRUCTION TIME OF 
	THE INSTRUCTION. IF IT IS A CHECK IS MADE TO DETERMINE IF THIS
	INSTRUCTION IS TO BE PRINTED. DONE BY MASKING THE INSTRUCTION
	CODE BITS WITH THE WORD 'MASK' AND THEN FURTHER DELIMITING THE
	INSTRUCTION BY A 'CAME' INSTRUCTION WITH THE WORD 'INSTR'. 
	THE PC OF THE INSTRUCTION IS ALSO CHECKED AGAINST 'CNTLPC' AND
	'UPRPC' AND MUST BE BETWEEN THIS RANGE TO BE PRINTED.

	AN EXAMPLE TO PRINT SIMULATION OF THE INSTRUCTIONS IN THE RANGE
	100 TO 177 WOULD BE:

		MASK=700000,,0
		INSTR=100000,,0
		CNTLPC=0,,0
		UPRPC=0,,-1

	IF THE INSTRUCTION PASSES THESE TESTS THE PRINT CONTROL IS SET
	ACCORDINGLY. THEN THE PC, AND INSTRUCTION ARE PRINTED. THEN
	THE MACHINE STATES ARE PRINTED (IF CALLED FOR BY SW29, PNTMS)
	UNTIL THE START OF THE NEXT INSTRUCTION.  AT THIS TIME THE
	INITIAL AND FINAL FLAG AND REGISTER RESULTS ARE PRINTED.
	AT THE COMPLETION OF EACH MACHINE STATE PRINTOUT A TRANSFER
	IS MADE BACK TO THE MAIN SIMULATOR TO CONTINUE SIMULATION. 
	TRANSFER FROM AND TO THE MAIN SIMULATOR IS DONE ON EACH
	MASTER CLOCK CYCLE WITH THE INSTRUCTION AND/OR MACHINE PSEUDO
	REGISTER CONTENTS PRINTED IF CALLED FOR.
