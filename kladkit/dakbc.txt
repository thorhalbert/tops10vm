1.0	ABSTRACT

	THIS PDP-10 KA10 BASIC INSTRUCTION RELIABILITY TEST
	IS THE THIRD IN A SERIES OF PDP-10 KA10 PROCESSOR
	RANDOM NUMBER DIAGNOSTICS.

	THE DIAGNOSTIC TESTS TESTS, HALF WORD, ADD/SUB, JFFO, ETC.
	IN THE MAJORITY OF CASES EACH INSTRUCTION IS TESTED BY
	SIMULATING THE INSTRUCTION, WITH SIMPLER INSTRUCTIONS, AND
	THEN EXECUTING THE INSTRUCTION.  RANDOM NUMBERS ARE USED AS
	THE OPERANDS IN AC AND/OR C(E).  THE RESULTS OF THE
	SIMULATION AND EXECUTION ARE COMPARED AND AN ERROR MESSAGE
	IS PRINTED IF THE RESULTS ARE NOT EQUAL.

2.0	REQUIREMENTS

2.1	EQUIPMENT

	A PDP-10 KA10 EQUIPPED WITH A MINIMUM OF 32K OF MEMORY

	CONSOLE TELETYPE
	DECTAPE
	LINE PRINTER (OPTIONAL)

2.2	STORAGE

	THE PROGRAM RUNS WITHIN 32K OF MEMORY.

3.0	PROGRAM PROCEDURES

3.1	LOADING PROCEDURE

	THIS DIAGNOSTIC REQUIRES THAT THE DECSYSTEM10 SUBROUTINE
	PROGRAM BE RESIDENT IN THE PDP-10.

	DECTAPE - LOAD WITH DIAMON (DECTAPE DEVICE CODE 320)
	TIME SHARING - RUN UNDER DIAMON.

3.2	STARTING PROCEDURE

	A.  SELECT OPERATIONAL CONSOLE DATA SWITCH SETTINGS (REFER TO
	    4.0 DATA SWITCH FUNCTIONS).

	B.  EXEC MODE

	    STAND-ALONE STARTING ADDRESS IS 30000.

	C.  USER MODE

	    RUN UNDER "DIAMON".
	    IN USER MODE THE FOLLOWING QUESTIONS WILL BE ASKED TO 
	    SELECT THE OPERATIONAL SWITCHES:

		    TELETYPE SWITCH CONTROL ? 0,S,Y OR N (CR) -

		    IF THE OPERATOR TYPES "N", THE ACTUAL CONSOLE
		    SWITCHES ARE USED.

		    IF THE OPERATOR TYPES "Y", THE FOLLOWING QUESTIONS
		    ARE ASKED AND THE OPERATOR RESPONDS BY TYPING
		    THE ANSWER AS SIX OCTAL DIGITS REPRESENTING
		    THE DESIRED SWITCH SETTINGS.

		    SPECIFY LH SWITCHES IN OCTAL-

		    SPECIFY RH SWITCHES IN OCTAL-

		    IF THE OPERATOR TYPES "0", ZERO'S ARE USED FOR
		    THE SWITCH SETTINGS.

		    IF THE OPERATOR TYPES "S", PREVIOUSLY SET SWITCHES
		    ARE USED.  THIS IS ONLY VALID UPON RESTARTING
		    OF AN INTERRUPTED PROGRAM.

3.3	OPERATING PROCEDURE

	NORMAL OPERATION WITH ALL SWITCHES SET TO ZERO IS QUICK
	VERIFY MODE.  TO RELIABILITY TEST SET THE "RELIAB" SWITCH.

	A.  TO THROUGHLY TEST ALL HARDWARE, ALL TEST CONTROL DATA 
	    SWITCHES SHOULD BE SET TO 0.

	B.  WHEN DEBUGGING HARDWARE, SET SWITCHES TO 0.  ALLOW THE 
	    TELETYPE TO PRINT THE ERROR MESSAGES.  THIS ALLOWS THE 
	    PROGRAM TO RUN A COMPLETE PASS AND THEN THE ERROR MESSAGES
	    MAY BE CORRELATED TO QUICKLY DIAGNOSE THE FAILURE.  IF A
	    HARDWARE PROBLEM IS SUCH THAT THE ERROR MESSAGES, AFTER THE
	    FIRST ONE, HAVE NO MEANING (FIRST ERROR CAUSES ALL FOLLOWING
	    TESTS TO FAIL) SET THE LOOP ON ERROR SWITCH AND RESTART THE
	    TEST FROM THE BEGINNING.  THE FIRST FAILURE WILL THEN CAUSE
	    THE PROGRAM TO ENTER A LOOP SUITABLE FOR SCOPING.

	    THE ERROR MESSAGE USED IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE LISTING AND
	    SCOPING IF NECESSARY SHOULD ALLOW THE FAILING CONPONENT 
	    TO BE ISOLATED AND REPLACED AND/OR REPAIRED.

	C.  WHEN TAKING MARGINS, SET DATA SWITCHES 'NOPNT' AND 'DING'.
	    THIS WILL INHIBIT PRINTOUT BUT WILL ALLOW THE TELETYPE
	    BELL TO BE RUNG WHEN A ERROR OCCURS.  IF THE MARGIN OBTAINED
	    IS UNACCEPTABLE, THE OPERATOR MAY REVERT TO STANDARD SWITCH
	    SETTINGS FOR DEBUGGING PURPOSES.

	D.  ERROR INFORMATION MAY BE OBTAINED QUICKLY BY PRINTING 
	    ERRORS ON THE LINE PRINTER.

	E.  IN THE EVENT OF A PRINT ROUTINE FAILURE THE 'NOPNT' SWITCH
	    AND THE 'ERSTOP' SWITCH MAY BE SET TO INHIBIT PRINTOUT 
	    BUT HALT THE PROGRAM POINTING TO THE ERROR.

5.0	ERRORS

	ERRORS ARE PRINTED ON THE TTY OR LINE PRINTER.  THE ERROR 
	PRINTOUT CONTAINS THE TEST TITLE, THE PC OF THE FAILURE, AC
	NUMBER, ERROR WORD AND CORRECT WORD.

	THE PC VALUE IS USEFUL IN RELATING THE FAILURE TO THE LISTING.

	WHEN THE SCOPE LOOP MODE IS USED THE MI REGISTER WILL COUNT 
	FOR EACH OCCURANCE OF AN ERROR.  IF AN AUDIO INDICATION OF
	A CONTINUING ERROR IS DESIRED THE 'DING' SWITCH MAY BE SET.

	THE FOLLOWING IS THE DIFFERENT ERROR FORMATS WITH THEIR
	RESPECTIVE UUO'S AND ERROR MESSAGES.

6.0	ITERATION COUNTER

	THE ITERATION COUNT OF THE PROGRAM IS DISPLAYED IN THE MEMORY
	INDICATORS (MI).  THIS COUNT IS A DECREMENTING COUNT AND 
	INITIALLY STARTS AT -1 IN STAND-ALONE OPERATION.

7.0	CYCLE TIME

	A.  NORMAL OPERATION - APPROXIMATELY FIVE SECONDS.

	B.  RELIABILITY MODE - APPROXIMATELY 1.5 TO 3 MINUTES.

8.0	OPERATIONAL VARIATIONS

	A.  DIAGNOSTIC MONITOR

	    THE PROGRAM IS USABLE WITH THE DIAGNOSTIC MONITOR TO PROVIDE
	    RELIABILITY TESTS, ACCEPTANCE TESTS, AND/OR TO PROVIDE A
	    QUICK METHOD OF ISOLATION OF A FAULT TO A PARTICULAR AREA
	    OF THE PROCESSOR.  CERTAIN PROCEDURES ARE USED WHEN THE
	    PROGRAM IS USED IN THIS MANNER.  THEY ARE:

	    1.	THE DIAGNOSTIC MONITOR TRANSFERS CONTROL TO THE PROGRAM
		AND STARTS IT AT LOCATION 30002.

	    2.	MONCTL - LOCATION 30043 IS USED AS THE DIAGNOSTIC MONITOR
		CONTROL WORD.
			LH = 0, STAND-ALONE OPERATION
			    -1, RUNNING UNDER DIAGNOSTIC MONITOR

			RH = RIGHT HALF OF CONSOLE SWITCHES IF UNDER
			     DIAGNOSTIC MONITOR CONTROL.

8.0	OPERATIONAL VARIATIONS (CON'T)

	B.  USER MODE

	    TO OUTPUT THE PRINTED ERROR MESSAGES TO A USER SPECIFIED
	    DEVICE IN USER MODE, ASSIGN THE DESIRED OUTPUT DEVICE TO
	    DEVICE NAME 'DEV' AND SET SWITCH 'PNTLPT'.  THE PHYSICAL
	    DEVICE USED CAN BE ANY DEVICE THAT CAN ACCEPT ASCII OUTPUT
	    FORMAT SUCH AS LPT, DSK, DTA, ETC.  THE CORRESPONDING 
	    OUTPUT FILE IS 'DAKBC.TMP'

	    EXAMPLE DEVICE ASSIGNMENT:

	    .ASSIGN DSK DEV

	    IN USER MODE THE PROGRAM WILL MAKE 1000(8) PASSES AND THEN
	    RETURN TO DIAMON COMMAND MODE.

	THE OUTPUT FILE (IF USED) MAY THEN BE LISTED BY USING THE
	NORMAL MONITOR COMMANDS (PRINT, LIST, TYPE, PIP, ETC.).

	IF THE PROGRAM IS ABORTED BEFORE COMPLETION (BY ^C, ETC.) THE
	OUTPUT FILE MAY BE CLOSED BY USING THE MONITOR 'REENTER' 
	COMMAND.

	C.  SYSTEM EXERCISER

	    START ADDRESS IS 30003.  DATA SWITCHES ARE PRESTORED IN
	    'SWTEXR' LOC 30023.

9.0	MISCELLANEOUS

	THE NON-EX-MEMORY AND PARITY STOP SWITCHES SHOULD BE RESET 
	(0).  THESE ERRORS, ILLEGAL UUO'S AND OTHER ERRORS OF THIS
	TYPE ARE HANDLED BY PRINTOUT ON THE TELETYPE.
