1.0	ABSTRACT
	--------

	THIS DECSYSTEM 2020 CPU & MEMORY RELIABILITY TEST IS A
	COMPREHENSIVE RELIABILITY TEST OF THE COMPLETE
	PROCESSOR-MEMORY SUBSYSTEM.  THE PROGRAM
	INCLUDES ARITHMETIC INSTRUCTION TESTING WITH RANDOM OPERANDS,
	RANDOM INSTRUCTION TESTING, INTERRUPT TESTING AND
	MEMORY RELIABILITY TESTING.

	THE ARITHMETIC TESING IS DONE USING PSEUDO-RANDOM NUMBERS
	AND COMPARING THE MACHINE RESULTS WITH EACH OTHER AND WITH
	A HARDWARE OPERATION SIMULATION PROGRAM. 

	THE RANDOM INSTRUCTION TESTING PROGRAM IS DESIGNED TO
	EXECUTE RANDOM INSTRUCTIONS (NON-PC CHANGE) IN MEMORY,
	IN THE FAST AC'S, AND THRU SOFTWARE SIMULATION.
	THE RESULTS OF THE THREE GROUPS OF INST ARE COMPARED FOR
	EQUALITY.  UPON A DISCREPENCY THE PROGRAM PRINTS ALL
	PERTINENT INFORMATION AND GOES INTO A REPETITIVE FAILURE LOOP.

	THE INTERRUPT PORTION OF THE DIAGNOSTIC TESTS THE PRIORITY
	INTERRUPT SYSTEM, THE PROCESSOR APR SYSTEM AND THE
	INTERRUPTABILITY OF MOST CLASSES OF INSTRUCTIONS.
	IT ALSO TESTS  NON-EX-MEMORY INTERRUPTS AND BLT INSTRUCTION
	INTERRUPTABILITY.

	THE MEMORY RELIABILITY PORTION OF THE TEST IS USED TO VERIFY
	THE OPERATIONS OF THE MEMORY SUBSYSTEM.  ALL OF MEMORY, UP TO
	1024K, IS USED IF AVAILABLE.  A PHYSICAL MEMORY ADDRESS
	TEST AND A RANDOMLY SELECTED DATA PATTERNS TEST ARE PERFORMED.
	MEMORY ADDRESSING IS VERIFIED BY USING A FAST-RATE ADDRESSING
	SCHEME WHEREBY THE SELECTED ADDRESS BIT WILL CHANGE ON EVERY
	MEMORY ACCESS.  THE FAST RATE TESTING IS RANDOMLY SELECTED AND
	DEPENDING ON THE SELECTION WILL HAVE ALL ADDRESS BITS FAST-RATED
	OR ANY ONE ADDRESS BIT OR NO FAST-RATE TESTING PERFORMED.

3.2	STARTING PROCEDURE
	------------------

	A.  SELECT OPERATIONAL CONSOLE DATA SWITCH SETTINGS (REFER TO
	    4.0 DATA SWITCH FUNCTIONS).

	    THE FOLLOWING QUESTIONS WILL BE ASKED TO
	    SELECT THE OPERATIONAL SWITCHES:

		TELETYPE SWITCH CONTROL: ? 0,S OR Y -

	IF THE OPERATOR TYPES "Y", THE FOLLOWING QUESTIONS ARE ASKED
	TO SPECIFY THE SWITCH SETTINGS:

		LH SWITCHES  -

		RH SWITCHES  -

	IF THE OPERATOR TYPES "0", ZERO'S ARE USED FOR THE SWITCH SETTINGS.

	IF THE OPERATOR TYPES "S", PREVIOUSLY SET SWITCHES ARE USED.
	THIS IS ONLY VALID UPON RESTARTING OF AN INTERRUPTED
	PROGRAM.

	B.  EXEC MODE -

	    STAND-ALONE STARTING ADDRESS IS 30000.

	    SPECIAL FEATURE START (CLEAR ALL TOTALS) IS 30004.

	    RESTART ADDRESS, AFTER POWER DOWN, IS 30005.

	C.  TIME-SHARING MODE -

	    LOAD AND RUN VIA SMMON, THE PROGRAM WILL RUN 2 PASSES
	    AND THEN RETURN TO SMMON.  TO THEN CONTINUALLY RUN
	    TYPE "G" TO SMMON.

	D.  IF IT IS DESIRED TO SPECIFY THE INITIAL BASE RANDOM NUMBER
	    SET SWITCH 'RANBAS' (BEFORE STARTING) AND RESPOND TO THE FOLLOWING
	    TYPE-OUT ACCORDINGLY.

		SPECIFY RANDOM NUMBER BASE -

3.3	OPERATING PROCEDURE
	-------------------

	A.  TO THROUGHLY TEST ALL HARDWARE ALL TEST CONTROL DATA
	    SWITCHES SHOULD BE SET TO 0.

	B.  WHEN DEBUGGING HARDWARE, SET SWITCHES TO 0.  ALLOW THE
	    TELETYPE TO PRINT THE ERROR MESSAGES.  THIS ALLOWS THE
	    PROGRAM TO RUN A COMPLETE PASS AND THEN THE ERROR MESSAGES
	    MAY BE CORRELATED TO QUICKLY DIAGNOSE THE FAILURE.  IF A
	    HARDWARE PROBLEM IS SUCH THAT THE ERROR MESSAGES, AFTER
	    THE FIRST ONE, HAVE NO MEANING SET THE LOOP ON ERROR
	    SWITCH AND RESTART THE PROGRAM.  THE FIRST FAILURE WILL
	    THEN CAUSE THE PROGRAM TO ENTER A LOOP SUITABLE FOR SCOPING.

	C.  WHEN TAKING MARGINS, SET DATA SWITCHES 'NOPNT' AND 'DING'.
	    THIS WILL INHIBIT PRINTOUT BUT WILL ALLOW THE TELETYPE BELL
	    TO BE RUNG WHEN AN ERROR OCCURS. IF THE MARGIN OBTAINED IS
	    UNACCETABLE, THE OPERATOR MAY REVERT TO STANDARD SWITCH
	    SETTINGS. TO INCREASE THE DUTY, FACTOR AND DECREASE THE
	    PROBABILITY OF SIMULATOR FAILURES, SWITCH 'FAST' MAY BE USED.
	    THIS, HOWEVER, IS NOT A COMPLETE TEST OF THE HARDWARE
	    AND SHOULD BE USED WITH CAUTION.

	D.  THE PROGRAM SHOULD RUN SEVERAL HOURS TO ALLOW ENOUGH
	    RANDOM NUMBERS TO BE PROCESSED TO VERIFY SYSTEM
	    RELIABILITY.

11.0	SIMULATOR
	---------

	THE PDP-10 KS10 SIMULATOR IS USED TO SIMULATE THE ACTUAL 
	HARDWARE OPERATION OF THE PDP-10 KS10 CENTRAL PROCESSOR. THE
	PURPOSE OF THIS SIMULATION PROGRAM IS TO PROVIDE A
	MEANS OF HARDWARE DEVELOPMENT AND MACHINE CHECKOUT. THE
	SIMULATION PROGRAM MAY ALSO BE USED FOR DIAGNOSTIC PROGRAM
	DEVELOPMENT AND AS A PROGRAM OPERATION TRACE DEBUG SYSTEM. 
	THE SIMULATION IS ACCOMPLISHED THROUGH SOFTWARE BY USING PROGRAM
	ROUTINES TO FOLLOW THE HARDWARE OPERATION FLOW AND MEMORY
	LOCATIONS AS PSEUDO HARDWARE REGISTERS.

	A. DDT PROGRAM TYPE-IN SIMULATION
	   ------------------------------

	TO USE THE SIMULATOR TO SIMULATE A SMALL PROGRAM TYPED-IN
	WITH DDT THE FOLLOWING PROCEDURE (EXAMPLE) IS USED.

	START PROGRAM WITH SWITCH 'ENTDDT' SET SO THAT CONTROL TRANSFERS
	TO DDT.

	*DDT*

	SIMDDT$G		;TRANSFER TO SIMULATOR

	INPC =   RIGHT HALF IS OBJECT PROGRAM STARTING ADDRESS
		 LEFT HALF = 0 = EXEC MODE OBJECT PROGRAM
			   =10000 = USER MODE OBJECT PROGRAM

	MASK =   WORD TO ALLOW CHECKING OF ONLY DESIRED INSTRUCTION CODE
		 BITS TO DETERMINE INSTRUCTION SIMULATION PRINTOUT.

	INSTR = WORD TO FURTHER SELECT INSTRUCTIONS TO BE PRINTED.
	CNTLPC = WORD USED TO PREVENT SIMULATION PRINTOUT UNTIL THE
		 OBJECT PROGRAM PC IS EQUAL OR GREATER.

	UPRPC = WORD USED TO PREVENT SIMULATION PRINTOUT WHEN THE
		OBJECT PROGRAM PC IS GREATER THAN.
						MAINDEC-10-DSKDA.TXT
							PAGE 15

	B.  SIMULATOR PRINT PROGRAM
	    -----------------------

	THE SIMULATOR PRINT PROGRAM PROVIDES A BREAK POINT IN THE 
	MAIN SIMULATOR MASTER CLOCK CYCLE AT WHICH TIME TRANSFER IS MADE 
	TO  THE SIMULATOR PRINT PROGRAM.  THE PRINT PROGRAM THEN DETER-
	MINES IF THE MASTER CLOCK IS AT THE FIRST INSTRUCTION TIME OF 
	THE INSTRUCTION. IF IT IS A CHECK IS MADE TO DETERMINE IF THIS
	INSTRUCTION IS TO BE PRINTED. DONE BY MASKING THE INSTRUCTION
	CODE BITS WITH THE WORD 'MASK' AND THEN FURTHER DELIMITING THE
	INSTRUCTION BY A 'CAME' INSTRUCTION WITH THE WORD 'INSTR'. 
	THE PC OF THE INSTRUCTION IS ALSO CHECKED AGAINST 'CNTLPC' AND
	'UPRPC' AND MUST BE BETWEEN THIS RANGE TO BE PRINTED.

	AN EXAMPLE TO PRINT SIMULATION OF THE INSTRUCTIONS IN THE RANGE
	100 TO 177 WOULD BE:

		MASK=700000,,0
		INSTR=100000,,0
		CNTLPC=0,,0
		UPRPC=0,,-1

	IF THE INSTRUCTION PASSES THESE TESTS THE PRINT CONTROL IS SET
	ACCORDINGLY. THEN THE PC, AND INSTRUCTION ARE PRINTED. THEN
	THE MACHINE STATES ARE PRINTED (IF CALLED FOR BY SW29, PNTMS)
	UNTIL THE START OF THE NEXT INSTRUCTION.  AT THIS TIME THE
	INITIAL AND FINAL FLAG AND REGISTER RESULTS ARE PRINTED.
	AT THE COMPLETION OF EACH MACHINE STATE PRINTOUT A TRANSFER
	IS MADE BACK TO THE MAIN SIMULATOR TO CONTINUE SIMULATION. 
	TRANSFER FROM AND TO THE MAIN SIMULATOR IS DONE ON EACH
	MASTER CLOCK CYCLE WITH THE INSTRUCTION AND/OR MACHINE PSEUDO
	REGISTER CONTENTS PRINTED IF CALLED FOR.
