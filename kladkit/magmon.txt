1.0	ABSTRACT

	THE DECSYSTEM DIAGNOSTIC MONITOR IS AN EXEC OR USER MODE
	PROGRAM WHICH WILL CALL FROM THE SELECTED MAGTAPE DEVICE IN EXEC
	MODE AND THE MAGTAPE OR DISK SYSTEM IN USER MODE AND EXECUTE THE
	PDP-10 DIAGNOSTIC PROGRAMS EITHER SINGLY OR AUTOMATICALLY.
	THE MONITOR IS INTENDED TO ALLOW RAPID CHECKOUT OF THE
	COMPUTER SYSTEM AND TO ISOLATE HARDWARE PROBLEMS IN THE
	QUICKEST POSSIBLE TIME.  THE MONITOR WILL ALSO PROVIDE THE
	SEQUENCING AND CONTROL NEEDED FOR THE DIAGNOSTIC PROGRAMS
	SO THAT ACCEPTANCE TESTS, START-UP RELIABILITY TESTS,
	AND/OR UNATTENDED OVERNIGHT TESTS MAY BE RUN.

	THIS DIAGNOSTIC MAGTAPE MONITOR IS DESIGNED TO FUNCTION LIKE
	DIAMON (MAINDEC-10-DDQDC) WITH THE ONLY DIFFERENCE BEING
	THE LOAD DEVICES SUPPORTED.  MAGMON MUST BE USED WHEN LOADING
	FROM MAGTAPE IS DESIRED.  DIAMON MUST BE USED WHEN LOADING FROM
	ANY DEVICE OTHER THAN MAGTAPE IN EXEC MODE.  EITHER MAGMON
	OR DIAMON MAY BE USED WHEN LOADING FROM DISK IN USER MODE.

	THE DECSYSTEM10 SUBROUTINE PROGRAM AND DDT ARE AUTOMATICALLY
	LOADED ON SYSTEM STARTUP OR DEVICE SPECIFICATION IF THEY ARE
	NOT ALREADY RESIDENT IN THE PDP-10 MEMORY.

	THE KL10 AND/OR KI10 DIAGNOSTIC MONITOR SPECIAL ROUTINES
	OPERATE AS PART OF THE DIAGNOSTIC MONITOR TO PROVIDE
	ADDITIONAL KL10 AND/OR KI10 FEATURES.

	THESE FEATURES ARE:

	KL10 & KI10 - SPECIAL USER MODE
	KI10 - MARGIN OPERATION.

	PROGRAM CONTAINS ROUTINES FOR:
	MARGINNING
	USER PAGE MAP SETUP
	USER MODE CONTROL
	TRAPPED I/O PROCESSING
	ADDITIONAL CONTROL SEQUENCING.

						PAGE 8

	THE DIAGNOSTIC MONITOR OPERATES ON A COMMAND LIST OF PROGRAMS
	WHICH IT WILL EXECUTE.  THIS LIST MAY BE READ IN FROM THE
	SELECTED LOAD DEVICE, TYPED IN FROM THE TELETYPE OR PREVIOUSLY
	READ/TYPED IN.

	1.  IF THE COMMAND LIST IS TO BE TYPED IN, TYPE "T".  THE
	    MONITOR WILL NOW ACCEPT TYPE-IN FROM THE KEYBOARD.
	    THE COMMAND LIST FORMAT IS GIVEN IN 5.0.

	2.  IF THE COMMAND LIST IS TO BE READ FROM THE LOAD DEVICE,
	    TYPE "D".

	3.  TO LOAD AND RUN A SINGLE PROGRAM, TYPE "S".

	    THE SPECIFIED PROGRAM WILL BE LOADED AND RUN THE NUMBER OF
	    OF ITERATIONS AS SPECIFIED IN THE PROGRAM BY "ITERAT".

	    TO CONTINUE OPERATION OF THE SAME PROGRAM AFTER IT RETURNS
	    TO "MAGMON", TYPE "G".

	4.  THE COMMAND LIST REMAINS IN CORE SO THAT IF THE MONITOR IS
	    RESTARTED THE COMMAND LIST DOES NOT HAVE TO BE READ IN AGAIN
	    UNLESS A NEW COMMAND LIST OR SINGLE PROGRAM IS SELECTED.

	    TO USE THE SAME COMMAND LIST, TYPE "I".

	THE DIAGNOSTIC MONITOR WILL NOW READ IN AND EXECUTE THE FIRST
	PROGRAM ON THE COMMAND LIST.  THE PROGRAM WILL BE ITERATED THE
	REQUESTED NUMBER OF TIMES AND CONTROL WILL THEN REVERT TO THE
	MONITOR.  THE MONITOR WILL THEN PROCEED TO THE NEXT PROGRAM
	ON THE LIST UNTIL ALL PROGRAMS REQUESTED HAVE BEEN EXECUTED.
	WHEN THE FINAL PROGRAM ON THE COMMAND LIST HAS BEEN EXECUTED,
	THE PASS COUNTER WILL BE PRINTED AND THEN THE MONITOR WILL
	RESTART WITH THE FIRST PROGRAM AGAIN.

	FOR EXAMPLE:

	MAGMON PASS 000001
	MAGMON PASS 000002
	ETC.

	WHEN SELECTING A SINGLE PROGRAM THE:

	"FILE.EXT -"

	QUESTION MAYBE ANSWERED WITH ONLY THE FILE NAME AS THE EXTENSION
	WILL DEFAULT TO ".A10" OR ".SAV" UNLESS THE CONSOLE LOAD
	DEVICE IS SELECTED AND THEN THE DEFAULT IS ".A10".

	5.  TO START THE PROGRAM JUST LOADED IF THE "FILE.EXT" ENDED
	    WITH A ALTMODE, OR TO RESTART THE PROGRAM, TYPE "G".

	6.  TO LIST A FILE FROM THE SELECTED LOAD DEVICE, TYPE "L".

	7.  TO OBTAIN A DIRECTORY OF THE SELECTED LOAD DEVICE, TYPE "F".

3.5	DIAGNOSTIC MONITOR SWITCHES

	A.  RELIAB, SW 9, UNLESS THIS SWITCH IS SET THE ITERATIONS
	    CONTAINED IN THE COMMAND LIST WILL BE REDUCED BY A FACTOR
	    OF 100(8):1 FOR FAST ITERATION OPERATION.
	    THIS PROVIDES A CONSIDERABLE REDUCTION IN THE RUN TIME OF
	    EACH PROGRAM FOR A QUICK CHECK OF HARDWARE OR FOR MARGIN
	    OPERATION.

	B.  CHAIN, SW 15, THIS INHIBITS THE TYPE-OUT OF THE "PROG.EXT"
	    OF THE PROGRAM PRIOR TO THE PROGRAM BEING LOADED AND
	    EXECUTED.
