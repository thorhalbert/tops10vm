1.0	ABSTRACT

	THE DECSYSTEM DIAGNOSTIC MONITOR IS AN EXEC OR USER MODE
	PROGRAM WHICH WILL CALL FROM THE SELECTED LOAD DEVICE IN EXEC
	MODE AND THE DISK SYSTEM IN USER MODE AND EXECUTE THE
	PDP-10 DIAGNOSTIC PROGRAMS EITHER SINGLY OR AUTOMATICALLY.
	THE MONITOR IS INTENDED TO ALLOW RAPID CHECKOUT OF THE
	COMPUTER SYSTEM AND TO ISOLATE HARDWARE PROBLEMS IN THE
	QUICKEST POSSIBLE TIME.  THE MONITOR WILL ALSO PROVIDE THE
	SEQUENCING AND CONTROL NEEDED FOR THE DIAGNOSTIC PROGRAMS
	SO THAT ACCEPTANCE TESTS, START-UP RELIABILITY TESTS,
	AND/OR UNATTENDED OVERNIGHT TESTS MAY BE RUN.

	THE DECSYSTEM SUBROUTINE PROGRAM AND DDT ARE AUTOMATICALLY
	LOADED ON SYSTEM STARTUP OR DEVICE SPECIFICATION IF THEY ARE
	NOT ALREADY RESIDENT IN THE PDP-10 MEMORY.

	THE KL10 AND/OR KI10 DIAGNOSTIC MONITOR SPECIAL ROUTINES
	OPERATE AS PART OF THE DIAGNOSTIC MONITOR TO PROVIDE
	ADDITIONAL KL10 AND/OR KI10 FEATURES.

	THESE FEATURES ARE:

	KL10 & KI10 - SPECIAL USER MODE
	KI10 - MARGIN OPERATION.

	PROGRAM CONTAINS ROUTINES FOR:
	MARGINNING
	USER PAGE MAP SETUP
	USER MODE CONTROL
	TRAPPED I/O PROCESSING
	ADDITIONAL CONTROL SEQUENCING.

	ALL COMMANDS END WITH A (CR).

	COMMANDS ARE AS LISTED ABOVE PLUS IF A SINGLE PROGRAM LOAD
	IS REQUIRED, THE FILE.EXT OF THE PROGRAM MAY BE TYPED TO
	THE "CMD - " QUESTION.
				MAINDEC-10-DDQDC.TXT (DIAMON)
						PAGE 7

	THE DIAGNOSTIC MONITOR OPERATES ON A COMMAND LIST OF PROGRAMS
	WHICH IT WILL EXECUTE.  THIS LIST MAY BE READ IN FROM THE
	SELECTED LOAD DEVICE, TYPED IN FROM THE TELETYPE OR PREVIOUSLY
	READ/TYPED IN.

	1.  IF THE COMMAND LIST IS TO BE TYPED IN, TYPE "T".  THE
	    MONITOR WILL NOW ACCEPT TYPE-IN FROM THE KEYBOARD.
	    THE COMMAND LIST FORMAT IS GIVEN IN 4.0.

	2.  IF THE COMMAND LIST IS TO BE READ FROM THE LOAD DEVICE,
	    TYPE "D".

	3.  TO LOAD AND RUN A SINGLE PROGRAM, TYPE "S".

	    THE SPECIFIED PROGRAM WILL BE LOADED AND RUN THE NUMBER OF
	    OF ITERATIONS AS SPECIFIED IN THE PROGRAM BY "ITERAT".

	    TO CONTINUE OPERATION OF THE SAME PROGRAM AFTER IT RETURNS
	    TO "DIAMON", TYPE "G".

	4.  THE COMMAND LIST REMAINS IN CORE SO THAT IF THE MONITOR IS
	    RESTARTED THE COMMAND LIST DOES NOT HAVE TO BE READ IN AGAIN
	    UNLESS A NEW COMMAND LIST OR SINGLE PROGRAM IS SELECTED.

	    TO USE THE SAME COMMAND LIST, TYPE "I".

	THE DIAGNOSTIC MONITOR WILL NOW READ IN AND EXECUTE THE FIRST
	PROGRAM ON THE COMMAND LIST.  THE PROGRAM WILL BE ITERATED THE
	REQUESTED NUMBER OF TIMES AND CONTROL WILL THEN REVERT TO THE
	MONITOR.  THE MONITOR WILL THEN PROCEED TO THE NEXT PROGRAM
	ON THE LIST UNTIL ALL PROGRAMS REQUESTED HAVE BEEN EXECUTED.
	WHEN THE FINAL PROGRAM ON THE COMMAND LIST HAS BEEN EXECUTED,
	THE PASS COUNTER WILL BE PRINTED AND THEN THE MONITOR WILL
	RESTART WITH THE FIRST PROGRAM AGAIN.

	FOR EXAMPLE:

	DIAMON PASS 000001
	DIAMON PASS 000002
	ETC.

						PAGE 8


	WHEN SELECTING A SINGLE PROGRAM THE:

	"FILE.EXT -"

	QUESTION MAYBE ANSWERED WITH ONLY THE FILE NAME AS THE EXTENSION
	WILL DEFAULT TO ".A10" OR ".SAV" UNLESS THE CONSOLE LOAD
	DEVICE IS SELECTED AND THEN THE DEFAULT IS ".A10".

	5.  TO START THE PROGRAM JUST LOADED IF THE "FILE.EXT" ENDED
	    WITH A ALTMODE, OR TO RESTART THE PROGRAM, TYPE "G".

	6.  TO LIST A FILE FROM THE SELECTED LOAD DEVICE, TYPE "L".

	7.  TO OBTAIN A DIRECTORY OF THE SELECTED LOAD DEVICE, TYPE "F".

3.4	LOAD DEVICES

	A.  PAPER TAPE

	B.  KLDCP - KL10 ONLY, USE KLDCP SELECTED DEVICE

	C.  D - PDP-10 FORMAT DECTAPE

	D.  V - PDP-11 FORMAT DECTAPE

	E.  P - DISK PACK, RP02/3/4/5/6 ON RP10, RH10 OR RH20.
				MAINDEC-10-DDQDC.TXT (DIAMON)
						PAGE 9

	WHEN THE DISK PACK IS SELECTED AS THE LOAD DEVICE THE MONITOR
	OPERATES FROM THE "DISK:[P,PN] THAT IS SPECIFIED.
	THE DEFAULT [P,PN] (PROJECT,PROGRAMMER NUMBER) IS 6,10.
	DISK PACK SEARCH WILL BE DONE FROM 'KLAD' & 'DSKA' TO
	'DSKO' IF NO DISK IS SPECIFIED.
	TO USE THE DEFAULTS TYPE A (CR).

	DEFAULTS:

	DISK:	'KLAD' & 'DSKA' TO 'DSKO'

	[P,PN]	6,10

	WHEN THE DECTAPE IS SELECTED AS THE LOAD DEVICE THE MONITOR
	WILL REQUEST THE UNIT NUMBER TO BE USED.  THE OPERATOR SHOULD
	RESPOND WITH A DIGIT 0-7 INDICATING WHICH DECTAPE UNIT
	CONTAINS THE PROGRAMS TO BE EXECUTED.  WHEN THE UNIT DIGIT
	HAS BEEN TYPED, THE MONITOR WILL READ THE DIRECTORY FOR THAT
	UNIT.

	TO OPERATE IN DECTAPE SEARCH MODE, RESPOND TO THE UNIT SELECTION
	QUESTION WITH AN "S".  THIS ALLOWS THE MONITOR TO SEARCH THRU
	ALL MOUNTED AND SELECTED DECTAPES TO FIND THE PROGRAM.

3.5	DIAGNOSTIC MONITOR SWITCHES

	A.  RELIAB, SW 9, UNLESS THIS SWITCH IS SET THE ITERATIONS
	    CONTAINED IN THE COMMAND LIST WILL BE REDUCED BY A FACTOR
	    OF 100(8):1 FOR FAST ITERATION OPERATION.
	    THIS PROVIDES A CONSIDERABLE REDUCTION IN THE RUN TIME OF
	    EACH PROGRAM FOR A QUICK CHECK OF HARDWARE OR FOR MARGIN
	    OPERATION.

	B.  CHAIN, SW 15, THIS INHIBITS THE TYPE-OUT OF THE "PROG.EXT"
	    OF THE PROGRAM PRIOR TO THE PROGRAM BEING LOADED AND
	    EXECUTED.

	C.  XPAND, SW 18, EXPAND CONTROL SEQUENCING

4.0	ROUTINE DESCRIPTIONS

	A. SPECIAL USER MODE

	A PSEUDO USER MODE WHERE THE DIAGNOSTIC PROGRAM BEING RUN
	IS RUN IN USER MODE (WITH PAGING, ETC.) AND THE I/O IS TRAPPED
	BACK TO THE DIAGNOSTIC MONITOR FOR PROCESSING.  PROVIDES A
	METHOD OF CHECKING USER MODE OPERATION OF THE INSTRUCTION
	DIAGNOSTIC AND RELIABILITY PROGRAMS WITHOUT HAVING TO USE A
	MONITOR AND TIMESHARING.

	B. MARGINS

	PROVIDES THE CONTROL NECESSARY TO OPERATE THE KI10 PROGRAMABLE
	MARGIN SYSTEM.  THE FOLLOWING WAYS OF RUNNING THE MARGIN SYSTEM
	ARE PROVIDED:

	1. SWEPT MARGINS

	   THE 5 VOLT POWER SUPPLIES ARE VARIED BY ONE INCREMENT STEPS
	   (21MV) UP TO AND DOWN TO THE +-.25V LIMITS.

	2. LIMITS

	   MARGINS ARE DONE AT THE +-.25V SETTINGS ONLY.

	3. INCREMENT

	   USER MAY SPECIFY THE MARGIN STEP PER PROGRAM PASS,
	   I.E. 4 ='S 84 MV STEPS.

	4. RACK

	   RUNS SWEPT MARGINS ON PROCESSOR RACK SPECIFIED.

	5. CLOCK MARGINS

	   SPEEDS UP THE BASIC CLOCK CYCLE BY 10%.
