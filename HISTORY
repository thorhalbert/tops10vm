Jan-2001 - Started project 

2-Feb-2001 - Finished op_halfwords, started op_bitops
4-Feb-2001 - Wrote various ADDs, MULs, etc - enough operations to start playing
5-Feb-2001 - Create Core space, Added *.SAV.ASC.bz2 loader
6-Feb-2001 - Added processor logic - got it to run the DAKAA KLAD diagnostic
	(in raw mode -- started directly at tests - dies when attempting
	to loop and print messages) - fixed a few bugs to get it to run
12-Feb-2001 - Passed the DAKAD diagnostic (history lacking here, passed
	DAKAB and DAKAC in the intervening time).  Added ADDB, XCT, JFCL
	and JRSTF amoung various fixes to others.  Extensive support for
	processor status word and proper flag-setting behavior of opcodes.
15-Feb-2001 - Passed the DAKAE diagnostic - began setting up infrastructure
	for doing I/O (pre_ks_io.c).  Passed DAKAF without modifications.
13-Mar-2001 - Broke out the KA processor handling and I/O devices into 
	the ka_sys directory.  Handle I/O by normal mechanism.  Worked on
	USER/EXEC mode, and IOT (User IO) mode.  Embrionic relocation
	and protection register for KA.  Now handles the LIGHTS IO (DATAO PI)
	instruction.
01-Mar-2002 - Filed project away for a year after the announcement of the
	simh simulators, and then the later klh-10 emulators (both fine
	programs).   Decided in this timeframe for a new idea for the
	project, and that was to emulate the base operating system instead.
	Added EXE file format, massive reorganization.  Added command line
	parser, PUSH* ops, IDB* ops, ROT*, LSH* ops,  several initial
	CALLIs,  debug operations, virtual memory/paging via unix.
02-Apr-2002 - Passed DAKAA through DAKAF after reorg in USER mode.  Starting
	back through diags and base functionality.   Got the stack functions
	working and got DAKAG to run.  Skipping DAKAH, since it is an EXEC
	MODE ONLY type program.
